## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) to run the local server and MySQL.
- Make sure Apache and MySQL are running in XAMPP.

### Setting Up the Database
1. Download the `.sql` file from the repository (located in the `database/` folder).
2. Open XAMPP and click on **Admin** next to **MySQL** to open phpMyAdmin.
3. In phpMyAdmin, create a new database. (You can name it something like `gym_management`).
4. Select the newly created database and click on the **Import** tab.
5. Choose the `.sql` file from the `database/` folder and click **Go** to import the database.
6. The tables and data will now be available in your local MySQL database.

### Setting up Razorpay Gateway
1. Sign up on Razorpay's Websiter and navigate to dashboard.
2. Generate API Keys and use test keys for Razorpay Payment gateway.
3. You will need to add keys in following files: plan_section/submitpayment.php, Gym User Management/razorpay_checkout.php, user/trainer/payment.php.
4. Add keys in the designated areas. For example: 
    // Razorpay API Key (Replace with your actual key)
    $razorpay_api_key = 'razorpay_test_key';

### Configuration
- Update your PHP configuration to connect to the local database. In your project, find the configuration file where the database connection is defined (e.g., `config.php` or `db.php`).
- Set the database host to `localhost`, username to `root`, and leave the password blank (default settings in XAMPP):
  ```php
  $host = 'localhost';
  $username = 'root';
  $password = ''; // default is empty in XAMPP
  $dbname = 'gym_management'; // name of your database
  ```

### Running the Project
- Open the project folder in your local XAMPP directory (usually `htdocs/`).
- Access the project by opening a browser and going to `http://localhost/your_project_folder_name`.
